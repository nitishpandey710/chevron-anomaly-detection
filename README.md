# Chevron Equipment Anomaly Detection & Log Correlation

This project simulates a real-world use case of detecting sensor anomalies in oilfield equipment and matching them with operator log messages using Machine Learning and LLM-based summarization.

## Use Case Summary

- Simulates hourly sensor readings (temperature, pressure, vibration).
- Detects anomalies using IsolationForest.
- Generates operator logs related to equipment behavior.
- Matches logs to anomalies using time window, equipment, and semantic similarity.
- Summarizes matched logs using OpenAI GPT-3.5 via LangChain.
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.
